<strong><h3 >1. Know your pimples</h3></strong>  

Sun Tzu was right. Knowing your enemy can help you win the war. And there’s no enemy like the pimples waging war on your face. There are six main types of pimples and they each need to be dealt with differently, so choose your solutions wisely.

 <strong><h3>2. Cleanse your face</h3></strong>

The most important thing to remember is to cleanse your face every morning and night. Dirt, dust, excess oil and make-up residue will have no chance of clogging your pores. Thankfully, adult pimples are not as severe as the teenage pimples you once had. So treatment should focus on soothing your skin to prevent inflammation.

For a gentle formula that provides deep cleansing, try Pond’s Pimple Clear Facial Foam. The skin experts at The Pond’s Institute discovered the power of combining these four active ingredients— Salicylic Acid, Herbal Clay, Gentle Scrubs Beads and Brightening Essence. This unique formula reaches deep inside your pores to wash away 99% of pimple-causing germs while fighting reddishness, white heads and black heads on the surface of your skin. So you’ll have clear, radiant skin outside.


<strong><h3>3. Find your pimple trigger</h3></strong>

Some people get breakouts from eating certain foods, while some see pimples bloom after a long phone call. In general, it’s best to regularly clean or disinfect the things that come into contact with your face. This includes bed linen, pillowcases, and even your mobile phone. Avoid aggravating your pimples by continuously exposing it to the bacteria that triggered it.
<strong><h3>4. Fight pimples from the inside</h3></strong>


In your quest for pimple-free skin, include pimple-fighting food in your diet for extra ammunition.

Fibre-rich food can help to flush out toxins in your digestive system, regulate blood flow and boost the cell renewal process. Food rich in protein and Vitamin A have anti-inflammatory properties and promote the growth of new skin tissues.

But of course, there’s no cookie-cutter method to this. We all react differently to different things. If you get a particularly bad breakout, think about what you may have eaten on the fateful day and avoid them.

 <strong><h3>5. Stop popping pimples</h3></strong>

Whatever the cause of your temptation, popping pimples is still one of the worst things you can do to your skin. It causes wounds that open up your skin to infection, inflammation and permanent pimple scars. Plus, you’re throwing away any chance it has of healing on its own!

 <strong><h3>6. Sleep</h3></strong>

Sleep is always the first to be sacrificed when you’re stressed, or out having fun. But when you’re sleep deprived, the body can take a longer time to heal surface wounds and fight pimple-causing germs in your pores. This might even result in severe pimples.

Taking power naps in the day can help you get enough beauty rest. If you’ve been powering through the week with very little sleep, make up for it during the weekends.
