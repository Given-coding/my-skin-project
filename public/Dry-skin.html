    <center><h1>Dry Skin-type</h1></center>
     Dry skin can be caused by issues with the skinâ€™s natural moisture barrier, or by external factors such as cold weather and excessive washing. <br>
     
     Dry skin exists on a scale. While it is universally characterized by its rough texture, it may begin to flake, peel or even crack depending on the severity. <br> If your skin is constantly dry, and shows signs of 
     cracking or bleeding, you have severely dry skin and may want to consult a dermatologist. <br>   
     
     In addition to texture, this skin type often appears dull with some redness and itching. On a positive note, dry skin is characterized by small pores and is usually not acne-prone. 
     
     
      <h2>Skin care tips for dry skin</h2>
     As harsh cleansers and astringents can exacerbate the symptoms of dry skin, choose gentle products and rich moisturizers instead. 
     

     <ul>
        <li>Use nonabrasive cleansers and cleansing techniques</li>
        <li>Use rich moisturizing products as needed </li>
        <li>Stay hydrated </li>
        <li>Use a humidifier in dry climates </li>
        <li>Protect skin from the drying effects of cold weather with physical barriers such as scarves</li>
      </ul>
