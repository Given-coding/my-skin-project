<p>
    Your skin is your number one in so many ways. From being your first line of defence from the elements, like harsh weather, pollution and excessive sunshine, to letting you step face-first into the world with radiant, glowing skin.

    So, having to deal with uneven skin tone, or even hyperpigmentation, can be something that truly puts a damper on your day and dulls your confidence. Trying to brainstorm solutions on how to treat hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone can be enough to induce a headache, but fret not, because the Pond’s Institute experts have the skin care solutions that will help fade those blemishes and uneven skin tone.
    
    In order to understand how to treat hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone, let’s begin with an understanding of what these skin conditions are and what causes them to occur.
    
    <h2>Understanding Hyperpigmentation and Uneven Skin Tone</h2> 
    <strong><h3 style="color:#991818 ;"> What is uneven skin tone?</h3></strong>
    
    Uneven skin tone is an umbrella term that refers to a number of skin issues such as redness, marks left by pimples and darkened patches on the forehead and cheeks. These patches can also be called hyperpigmentation.
    
    When we speak about hyperpigmentation, the hyper- refers to the overproduction of pigmentation, also known as melanin. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin, hair and eyes their colour. When an overproduction of melanin occurs, it results in patches of skin becoming darker than your natural skin tone, causing your skin tone to become uneven in appearance.
    
    <h2>Causes of Hyperpigmentation and Uneven Skin Tone</h2> 
    <strong><h3 style="color:#991818 ;">  What are the causes of hyperpigmentation?</h3></strong>
    
   
    
    There are several types of hyperpigmentation, each with their own unique causes. The most common types include melasma where hormonal changes trigger the body into excessive melanin production, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which is the result of the body over-producing melanin to try and protect itself after skin inflammation occurs, such as after a pimple.
    
   <strong><h3 style="color:#991818 ;">    What causes excess melanin? </h3></strong>
    
    One of the main culprits that causes your body to kick into melanin production high gear is sun damage from excessive sun exposure. When unprotected skin is exposed to the sun for prolonged periods, to protect itself from sun damage, the body goes into melanin production overdrive, which can result in hyperpigmentation of the affected areas.
    
     <h2>How to treat hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone</h2>
    With the help of Pond’s extensive range of skin care technologies and these top even tone tips, you’ll be well on your way to luminous, even-toned skin in no time.
    
    <strong><h3>    1. Cater to Your Skin Type </h3></strong>
    
    To give your skin the best care, you need to know your skin type. If you don’t know your skin type you run the risk of using products that aren’t appropriate for your skin, which could cause it to react. To figure out what your skin type is, try the tissue test. After washing your face wait for an hour and then pat your T-zone - which includes your forehead and nose - with a tissue. Look at the tissue and check if oil rubbed off on it. If it did, you either have oily or combination skin.
    
  <strong><h3 style="color:black ;">     2. Out With the Old  </h3></strong>
    
    For your go-to product (read Pond’s Perfect Colour Complex Anti Marks Serum Face Cream) to really be able to seep into your skin and help restore it to its even-toned glory, you need to make sure your face is free from the old skin cells sitting on your skin’s surface. So, clean your skin daily with a cleanser that reinforces your even-tone efforts like our Pond’s Perfect Colour Complex Anti Marks Face Wash Serum, clinically proven to fade dark marks. Then be sure to exfoliate at least once a week to usher in luminous, even-toned skin.
    
    <strong><h3>     3. Stay Out of the Sun    </h3></strong>
     
    
    Okay maybe that’s a little harsh, but excessive sun exposure is a major offender in causing hyperpigmentation. So while you don’t have to consider becoming a vampire, be mindful of how much time you spend in the sun and whenever you step outside, make sure you have a sufficient spread of sunscreen on all areas of exposed skin, to keep your skin protected. Wear protective clothing like a wide brimmed hat and sunglasses when you’re soaking in the sunshine, to help prevent sun damage.
    
    For your delicate face, use a moisturising cream that is high in SPF, like the Pond’s Flawless Radiance Derma+ Moisturising Day Cream with SPF 30, for added protection from the sun with a dose of moisturising goodness.
    
    Hyperpigmentation, while it may be an unavoidable condition, can still affect your self-confidence.
