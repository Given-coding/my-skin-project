   <center><h1>Combination Skin-type</h1></center> 


<p>
     <h2>What causes combination skin?</h2>
    According to board certified dermatologist and aesthetic expert Kavita Mariwalla, MD, FAAD, combination skin is common, just like other skin types.
    
    The difference is that combination skin is oily in some places and dry in others. For example, Mariwalla notes that it’s common to have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks.
    
    Nothing causes combination skin per se (it’s genetic), but it can change with hormonal and seasonal shifts.
    
    As we age, skin may become drier and less oily as it reacts to hormonal changes. Other hormone-driven factors that can cause changes in skin are periods and contraceptives.
    
   <h3>Signs of combination skin</h3> 
    A combination of oily and dry skin can appear in different ways and in different amounts.
    
    There’s no hard and fast rule to how it looks and feels, and it may change with the weather, lifestyle factors, and stress.
    
    With some observation, you can figure out exactly how your combination skin presents itself.
    
    <br> <br> Signs of oiliness may include:
    
    <ul>
    <li>shiny skin</li> 
    <li>larger-looking pores</li> 
    <li>acne</li> 
     
    </ul>
    Signs of dryness may include:
    <ul>
    <li>flaking</li> 
    <li>redness</li> 
    <li>feelings of tightness or roughness</li> 
     
    </ul>
    
    <h3> The best skin care routine for combination skin</h3>
    It’s a good idea to think conservatively when figuring out your skin care routine for combination skin.
    
    Go for gentle products that can moisturize dry areas without creating more oiliness, and only apply treatments to the needed areas for specific issues.
    
    <h3>A.M. routine</h3> 
    Use products in this order to help create more balanced skin.
    
    Cleanser. It’s important to remove any buildup that occurs overnight.
    Toner. Toner removes any oil that your cleanser didn’t and balances your skin’s pH levels. Make sure to grab an alcohol-free toner.
    Serum. Serums hydrate and protect your skin. It’s best to opt for a serum with hyaluronic acid.
    Moisturizer. With combination skin, you’ll want two moisturizers. For dry areas, choose a creamy formula. For oily parts, choose a lightweight, water-based formula.
    Sunscreen. Choose a lightweight formula with at least SPF 30.
    Makeup. If desired, use lightweight products. Foundation and concealer should have oil-free formulas.
    
    <h3>P.M. routine</h3> 
    In the evening, try applying products in this order:
    
    Makeup remover. If you wear makeup, makeup remover helps keep pores unclogged and gives your skin a chance to breathe. Micellar water is one of the gentlest products to use for this.
    Cleanser. Cleanse day and night. A nighttime cleanser should remove any makeup remnants in addition to natural buildup.
    Exfoliant. Once per week, exfoliants are great for removing dead skin cells, which keeps pores clear and relieves dry areas.
    Facial mask. Once per week, try multi-masking, which is when you apply different masks to different areas of the face.
    Serum, treatment, or moisturizer. Evenings are best for stronger products, so choose an emollient-rich moisturizer for dry areas.
    Ingredients to consider:
    Hyaluronic acid is ideal for your face, as it hydrates your skin without the greasiness that could aggravate oiliness.
    Salicylic acid may regulate oil production and help keep pores unclogged.
    Lactic acid acts as a mild exfoliant that removes dead skin cells from dry areas and gently clears pores.
    Emollients are things like shea butter and coconut oils that soften dry skin.
    Antioxidants protect you from environmental damage. Make sure to choose a product with vitamin C for general skin health. Be sure to wear sunscreen or use products with vitamin C at night to protect your skin from UV rays.
